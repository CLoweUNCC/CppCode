This is a short, text-based adventure game created in C++ using the mt19337 Mersenne Twister pseudo-random generator algorithm. The goal is to reach the "treasure" which is placed in a random location on the map (denoted as "Ruins"), before you (the player) run out of energy. Moving through different types of terrain have different effects on your energy levels. Most cost energy to traverse, some give energy, and some have no effect. In general, the larger the map, the more difficult the game can become.
