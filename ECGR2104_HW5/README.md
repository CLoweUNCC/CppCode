This is a short, text-based adventure game created using C++. The goal is to reach the "treasure" which is placed in a random location on the map (denoted as "Ruins"), before you (the player) run out of energy. Moving through different types of terrain have different effects on your energy levels.

Place the files in the same directory and then run "main.cpp" to play
