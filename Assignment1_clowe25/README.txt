hw1-a:
This program is very particular in how it operates. All inputs must be inputted on one line (or copy-pasted into it from a file). Upon pressing ENTER, the desired output will be displayed, minus the final subtotal and the grand total. Pressing CNTL+D will display the final subtotal and the grand total.

Program functions correctly ONLY if above steps are followed

NOTE 1: The user can input more after pressing enter, but be advised the subtotal from the final account of the previous input string will be the first item to display after the next string of inputs has been entered.

NOTE 2: All zeros on the front of both the accounts as well as expenses WILL be dropped in the output (Ex. 01234 will display as 1234, 00005 will display as 5, etc.)


hw1-b:
This program reads user inputted integers and outputs the total sum, the number of integers received, and the last three inputs. Integers can be typed on one line or each on individual lines.

Program functions correctly, including when program is terminated early before any input is entered


hw1-c:
This program reads strings from the user. Input any number of strings and then press ENTER. At this point, the user can enter more strings or press CTRL+D to end. Upon termination, the largest number of the same string inputted in a row will be displayed

Program functions correctly in all cases, including when program is terminated before any strings are entered
